# CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50

CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50 involves applying the ResNet50 architecture to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and so on. ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. By fine-tuning or training ResNet50 on CIFAR-10, the goal is to achieve high accuracy in correctly identifying the objects within these images. ResNet50 employs residual connections, allowing for deeper networks without encountering the vanishing gradient problem, which is crucial for handling the complexity of CIFAR-10 images. This combination of CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 serves as a benchmark for evaluating and comparing different image recognition models and techniques.

# The agenda for CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50 involves:
1. Data Preprocessing: Prepare CIFAR-10 dataset for training.
2. Model Architecture: Implement ResNet50 neural network.
3. Training: Train ResNet50 on CIFAR-10 dataset.
4. Evaluation: Assess model performance using test data.
5. Fine-tuning (optional): Adjust hyperparameters for optimization.
6. Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-world applications.

# Execution
This Repository consists of a notebook file for classifying objects. Unfortunately, I couldn't able to upload the trained model due to size limits. So, you can run this code to create your own model. Make Sure to replace the json file name at the beginning of the file.
